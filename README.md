This dashboard also provides you valuable information about your spending, such as:

-   How does your current month's spending look like?
-   How does your yearly spending trend look like?
-   Does your spending pattern in current month differ from that of average of last 12 months'?
-   For each spending category, how does your current month's improve from average of last 12 months'?

Note that: - Your data will not be stored remotely! If you refresh the dashboard, all results are gone and you need to upload the same csv file for results again. - There is a specific format for uploaded csv file. Category's name is listed on the first column (with a header as 'category'), with spending for each month in the following columns. Each month's spending should have a relevant header. Please have a look at the example screenshot in the Homepage. - You can have as many categories as possible. - In the csv file, please have spending of the past 12 months and current month.
